# Issues

## All Platforms

- Look into setting `MOZ_DISTRIBUTION_ID` to "com.teracet" and the effects of that

## Windows

- Uninstaller doesn't have an icon

## Mac

- Look into setting `MOZ_MACBUNDLE_ID`, `MOZ_MACBUNDLE_NAME`, `MAC_APP_NAME` (related: `MAC_BUNDLE_VERSION`) to change the installed app from "SQLiteWriter.app" to "SQLite Writer.app" (first try: `MOZ_MACBUNDLE_NAME` doesn't appear to have any effect)

## Linux

Nothing.
